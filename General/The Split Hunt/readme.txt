Mission:
The flag lies hidden behind a fractured key and a veil of encryption. Only the sharpest minds will piece it all together. Prove you're one of them.Each and every file deserve proper attention.

Rules:
Not everything is straightforward. Expect hidden layers, it’s not as simple as it seems.

Trial and error is part of the game, but brute force isn’t. Think logically.

The flag format is hacks{flag}.

Good Luck!
